It serves as the precursor for the prostaglandin-3 and thromboxane-3 families. A diet rich in eicosapentaenoic acid lowers serum lipid concentration, reduces incidence of cardiovascular disorders, prevents platelet aggregation, and inhibits arachidonic acid conversion into the thromboxane-2 and prostaglandin-2 families.&quot;,&quot;An anti-inflammatory agent, structurally related to the salicylates and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs like acetylsalicylic acid, which is active in inflammatory bowel disease [A174022]. It is considered to be the active moiety of sulphasalazine. (From Martindale, The Extra Pharmacopoeia, 30th ed) Although demonstrably effective in treating and maintaining remission for ulcerative colitis, mesalazine has historically faced a number of issues regarding its lack of stability as a pharmaceutical agent [A174019]. Throughout the late seventies and the eighties, important research initiatives developed stable mesalazine formulations like the eudragit-S coating of Asacol brand mesalazine and the Pentasa brand&#x27;s encapsulation of mesalazine within microgranules [A174019]. In the present day, contemporary research regarding novel methods to stabilize mesalazine continues and interest in the agent&#x27;s capacity to decrease inflammatory activity and subsequently potentially reduce the risk of colorectal cancer in conditions like ulcerative colitis is maintained [A174019, A174022].&quot;,&quot;Indometacin, or indomethacin, is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) with anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and antipyretic properties. NSAIDs consist of agents that are structurally unrelated; the NSAID chemical classification of indometacin is an indole-acetic acid derivative with the chemical name 1- (p-chlorobenzoyl)25-methoxy-2-methylindole-3-acetic acid.[A177871] The pharmacological effect of indometacin is not fully understood, however, it is thought to be mediated through potent and nonselective inhibition of the enzyme cyclooxygenase (COX), which is the main enzyme responsible for catalyzes the rate-limiting step in prostaglandin and thromboxane biosynthesis via the arachidonic acid (AA) pathway. Indometacin was first discovered in 1963 and it was first approved for use in the U.S. by the Food and Drug Administration in 1965, [A486] along with other acetic acid derivatives such as [diclofenac] and [sulindac] that were also developed during the 1960s.[A177871] Since then, indometacin has been extensively studied in clinical trials as one of the most potent NSAIDs in blocking prostaglandin synthesis and was among the first NSAIDs to be used in the symptomatic treatment of migraine and for headaches that eventually became known as \\u201cindomethacin-responsive\\u201d headache disorders.[A177871]   Most commonly used in rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, osteoarthritis, acute shoulder pains, and acute gouty arthritis, indometacin is currently available as oral capsules as well as other methods of administration, including rectal and intravenous formulations. Intravenous indometacin is administered to close a hemodynamically significant patent ductus arteriosus, as indicated by clinical evidence, in premature infants.[L10553] Ophthalmic indometacin has been studied and used in the symptomatic treatment of postoperative ocular inflammation and pain and/or complications after cataract surgery. Although deemed effective in reducing ocular inflammation in clinical studies, topical NSAIDs were also associated with a potential reduction in corneal sensitivity accompanied by an increased risk of superficial punctate keratitis and subjective symptoms of discomfort, including pain, burning or pricking, or a tingling sensation after instillation into the cul\\u2010de\\u2010sac.[A177949]&quot;,&quot;Nabumetone was originally developed as a non-acidic non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID).[label] It was thought to avoid trapping of the drug in the stomach by making it unable to dissociate into ions which was believed to reduce GI toxicity by limiting local action.[A179077] While slightly reduced, possibly due to a degree of cyclooxygenase-2 selectivity (COX-2), nabumetone still produces significant adverse effects in the GI tract.[label,A178903] The molecule itself is a pro-drug with its 6-methoxy-2-naphthylacetic acid (6-MNA) metabolite acting as a potent COX inhibitor similar in structure to [naproxen]. Nabumetone was developed by Smithkline Beecham under the trade name Relafen and first received FDA approval in December, 1991.[L6568]&quot;,&quot;Ketorolac is a Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) and is commercially available as an oral tablet, injectable, nasal spray and as an ophthalmic solution.[L6358][L6508][L6523][L6526][L6532]   It&#x27;s analgesic properties make it a useful pain management tool across many settings including postoperative pain, rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, menstrual disorders, headaches, spinal and soft tissue pain, and ankylosing spondylitis.[L6520] Impressively, ketorolac has a similar efficacy to standard doses of morphine and meperidine making it a useful opioid sparing agent.[L6511]&quot;,&quot;Tenoxicam, an antiinflammatory agent with analgesic and antipyretic properties, is used to treat osteoarthritis and control acute pain.&quot;,&quot;Celecoxib, a selective cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitor, is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) which is known for its decreased risk of causing gastrointestinal bleeding compared to other NSAIDS.[A181544] It is used to manage symptoms of various types of arthritis pain and in familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP)[L7586] to reduce precancerous polyps in the colon.[A181532] It is marketed by Pfizer under the brand name Celebrex, and was initially granted FDA approval in 1998.[L7604]   Interestingly, selective COX-2 inhibitors (especially celecoxib), have been evaluated as potential cancer chemopreventive and therapeutic drugs in clinical trials for a variety of malignancies.[A34124]&quot;,&quot;A non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agent (anti-inflammatory agents, NON-steroidal) similar in mode of action to indomethacin.&quot;,&quot;Rofecoxib is used for the treatment of osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, acute pain in adults, and primary dysmenorrhea, as well as acute treatment of migraine attacks with or without auras. Rofecoxib is a solid. This compound belongs to the stilbenes. These are organic compounds containing a 1,2-diphenylethylene moiety. Stilbenes (C6-C2-C6 ) are derived from the common phenylpropene (C6-C3) skeleton building block. The introduction of one or more hydroxyl groups to a phenyl ring lead to stilbenoids. Rofecoxib has a half-life of 17 hours and its mean oral bioavailability at therapeutically recommended doses of 125, 25, and 50 mg is approximately 93%. The proteins that rofecoxib target include elastin and prostaglandin G/H synthase 2. Cytochrome P450 1A2, Cytochrome P450 3A4, Cytochrome P450 2C9, Cytochrome P450 2C8, and Prostaglandin G/H synthase 1 are known to metabolize rofecoxib. On September 30, 2004, Merck voluntarily withdrew rofecoxib from the market because of concerns about increased risk of heart attack and stroke associated with long-term, high-dosage use.&quot;,&quot;A cyclooxygenase inhibiting, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agent (NSAID) that is well established in treating rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis and used for musculoskeletal disorders, dysmenorrhea, and postoperative pain. Its long half-life enables it to be administered once daily.&quot;,&quot;An anti-inflammatory analgesic and antipyretic highly bound to plasma proteins. It is pharmacologically similar to aspirin, but causes less gastrointestinal bleeding.&quot;,&quot;Valdecoxib was removed from the Canadian, U.S., and E.U. markets in 2005 due to concerns about possible increased risk of heart attack and stroke.&quot;,&quot;Diclofenac is a phenylacetic acid derivative and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID).[label] NSAIDs inhibit cyclooxygenase (COX)-1 and-2 which are the enzyme responsible for producing prostaglandins (PGs). PGs contribute to inflammation and pain signalling. Diclofenac, like other NSAIDs, is often used as first line therapy for acute and chronic pain and inflammation from a variety of causes. Diclofenac was the product of rational drug design based on the structures of [phenylbutazone], [mefenamic acid], and [indomethacin].[A180796] The addition of two chlorine groups in the ortho position of the phenyl ring locks the ring in maximal torsion which appears to be related to increased potency. It is often used in combination with [misoprostol] to prevent NSAID-induced gastric ulcers. Diclofenac was first approved by the FDA in July 1988 under the trade name Voltaren, marketed by Novartis (previously Ciba-Geigy).[L7360]&quot;,&quot;Sulindac is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) of the arylalkanoic acid class that is marketed by Merck under the brand name Clinoril. Like other NSAIDs, it may be used in the treatment of acute or chronic inflammatory conditions. Sulindac is a prodrug, derived from sulfinylindene, that is converted _in vivo_ to an active sulfide compound by liver enzymes. There is evidence from some studies that sulindac may be associated with fewer gastrointestinal side effects than other NSAIDs, except for the cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitor drug class. This may be due to the sulfide metabolite undergoing enterohepatic circulation thus maintaining constant blood levels of the compound without inducing gastrointestinal effects, where the drug is excreted in the bile and then reabsorbed from the intestines. While its full mechanism of action is not fully understood, sulindac is thought to primarily mediate its action by inhibiting prostaglandin synthesis by inhibiting COX-1 and COX-2.&quot;,&quot;Flurbiprofen, a propionic acid derivative, is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agent (NSAIA) with antipyretic and analgesic activity. Oral formulations of flurbiprofen may be used for the symptomatic treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis and anklylosing spondylitis. Flurbiprofen may also be used topically prior to ocular surgery to prevent or reduce intraoperative miosis. Flurbiprofen is structurally and pharmacologically related to fenoprofen, ibuprofen, and ketoprofen.&quot;,&quot;Etodolac is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) with anti-inflammatory, analgesic and antipyretic properties. Its therapeutic effects are due to its ability to inhibit prostaglandin synthesis. It is indicated for relief of signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis.&quot;,&quot;A non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agent with analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and antipyretic properties. It is an inhibitor of cyclooxygenase.&quot;,&quot;Naproxen is classified as a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory dug (NSAID) and was initially approved for prescription use in 1976 and then for over-the-counter (OTC) use in 1994.[A178975] It can effectively manage acute pain as well as pain related to rheumatic diseases, and has a well studied adverse effect profile.[A179098] Given it&#x27;s overall tolerability and effectiveness, naproxen can be considered a first line treatment for a variety of clinical situations requiring analgesia.[A179098] Naproxen is available in both immediate and delayed release formulations, in combination with sumatriptan to treat migraines, and in combination with esomeprazole to lower the risk of developing gastric ulcers.[L6582][L6583][L7309][L7312]&quot;,&quot;A drug that is used in the management of inflammatory bowel diseases. Its activity is generally considered to lie in its metabolic breakdown product, 5-aminosalicylic acid (see mesalamine) released in the colon. (From Martindale, The Extra Pharmacopoeia, 30th ed, p907)&quot;,&quot;A drug that has anti-inflammatory, antipyretic, and analgesic activities. It is especially effective in the treatment of ankylosing spondylitis. It also is useful in rheumatoid arthritis and Reiter&amp;#39;s syndrome (investigational indication). Although phenylbutazone is effective in gouty arthritis, risk/benefit considerations indicate that this drug should not be employed for this disease. (From AMA Drug Evaluations Annual, 1994, p1822)&quot;,&quot;Meloxicam is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) used to relieve the symptoms of arthritis, primary dysmenorrhea, fever; and as an analgesic, especially where there is an inflammatory component. It is closely related to piroxicam. In Europe it is marketed under the brand names Movalis, Melox, and Recoxa. In North America it is generally marketed under the brand name Mobic. In Latin America, the drug is marketed as Tenaron.&quot;,&quot;Carprofen is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that is used by veterinarians as a supportive treatment for the relief of arthritic symptoms in geriatric dogs. Carprofen was previously used in human medicine for over 10 years (1985-1995). It was generally well tolerated, with the majority of adverse effects being mild, such as gastro-intestinal pain and nausea, similar to those recorded with aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. It is no longer marketed for human usage, after being withdrawn on commercial grounds.&quot;,&quot;Diflunisal, a salicylate derivative, is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agent (NSAIA) with pharmacologic actions similar to other prototypical NSAIAs. Diflunisal possesses anti-inflammatory, analgesic and antipyretic activity. Though its mechanism of action has not been clearly established, most of its actions appear to be associated with inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis via the arachidonic acid pathway. Diflunisal is used to relieve pain accompanied with inflammation and in the symptomatic treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis.&quot;,&quot;An ibuprofen-type anti-inflammatory analgesic and antipyretic. It inhibits prostaglandin synthesis and has been proposed as an anti-arthritic. It is no longer approved for use in the United States.&quot;,&quot;A compound obtained from the bark of the white willow and wintergreen leaves, and also prepared synthetically. It has bacteriostatic, fungicidal, and keratolytic actions. Its salts, the salicylates, are used as analgesics.&quot;,&quot;A non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agent with antipyretic and antigranulation activities. It also inhibits prostaglandin biosynthesis.&quot;,&quot;Also known as _Aspirin_, acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) is a commonly used drug for the treatment of pain and fever due to various causes. Acetylsalicylic acid has both anti-inflammatory and antipyretic effects.  This drug also inhibits platelet aggregation and is used in the prevention of blood clots stroke, and myocardial infarction (MI) [FDA label].    Interestingly, the results of various studies have demonstrated that long-term use of acetylsalicylic acid may decrease the risk of various cancers, including colorectal, esophageal, breast, lung, prostate, liver and skin cancer [A177325]. Aspirin is classified as a _non-selective cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitor_ [A32682, A177268] and is available in many doses and forms, including chewable tablets, suppositories, extended release formulations, and others [L5968].   Acetylsalicylic acid is a very common cause of accidental poisoning in young children. It should be kept out of reach from young children, toddlers, and infants [FDA label].&quot;,&quot;Bromfenac is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) for ophthalmic use. Ophthalmic NSAIDs are becoming a cornerstone for the management of ocular pain and inflammation. Their well-characterized anti-inflammatory activity, analgesic property, and established safety record have also made NSAIDs an important tool to optimize surgical outcomes.&quot;,&quot;Oxaprozin is a non-narcotic, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), used to relieve the inflammation, swelling, stiffness, and joint pain associated with osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis.&quot;,&quot;Ketoprofen, a propionic acid derivative, is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agent (NSAIA) with analgesic and antipyretic properties.&quot;,&quot;Balsalazide is an anti-inflammatory drug used in the treatment of Inflammatory Bowel Disease. It is sold under the name Colazal in the US and Colazide in the UK.  The chemical name is (E)-5-[[-4-(2-carboxyethyl) aminocarbonyl] phenyl]azo] -2-hydroxybenzoic acid. It is usually administered as the disodium salt.  Balsalazide works by deliverying mesalazine to the large intestine to act directly on ulcerative colitis. Mesalazine is also known as 5-aminosalicylic acid, or 5-ASA.&quot;,&quot;Ibuprofen is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) derived from propionic acid and it is considered the first of the propionics.[A39074] The formula of ibuprofen is 2-(4-isobutylphenyl) propionic acid and its initial development was in 1960 while researching for a safer alternative for aspirin.[A39075] Ibuprofen was finally patented in 1961 and this drug was first launched against rheumatoid arthritis in the UK in 1969 and USA in 1974. It was the first available over-the-counter NSAID.[A39076]  On the available products, ibuprofen is administered as a racemic mixture. Once administered, the R-enantiomer undergoes extensive interconversion to the S-enantiomer _in vivo_ by the activity of the alpha-methylacyl-CoA racemase. In particular, it is generally proposed that the S-enantiomer is capable of eliciting stronger pharmacological activity than the R-enantiomer.[A39194]&quot;,&quot;Olsalazine is an anti-inflammatory drug used in the treatment of Inflammatory Bowel Disease and Ulcerative Colitis. Olsalazine is a derivative of salicylic acid. Inactive by itself (it is a prodrug), it is converted by the bacteria in the colon to mesalamine. Mesalamine works as an anti-inflammatory agent in treating inflammatory diseases of the intestines.&quot;,&quot;Lumiracoxib is a COX-2 selective non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). On August 11, 2007, Australia&#x27;s Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA, the Australian equivalent of the FDA) cancelled the registration of lumiracoxib in Australia due to concerns that it may cause liver failure. New Zealand and Canada have also followed suit in recalling the drug.&quot;,&quot;Salsalate is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agent for oral administration. Salsalate&#x27;s mode of action as an anti-inflammatory and antirheumatic agent may be due to inhibition of synthesis and release of prostaglandins. The usefulness of salicylic acid, the active in vivo product of salsalate, in the treatment of arthritic disorders has been established. In contrast to aspirin, salsalate causes no greater fecal gastrointestinal blood loss than placebo. Salsalate is readily soluble in the small intestine where it is partially hydrolyzed to two molecules of salicylic acid. A significant portion of the parent compound is absorbed unchanged and undergoes rapid esterase hydrolysis in the body. The parent compound has an elimination half-life of about 1 hour. Salicylic acid (the active metabolite) biotransformation is saturated at anti-inflammatory doses of salsalate. Such capacity limited biotransformation results in an increase in the half-life of salicylic acid from 3.5 to 16 or more hours.&quot;,&quot;Choline magnesium trisalicylate is a non-acetylated salicylate used widely as a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug. Trisalicylate significantly reduces methotrexate renal clearance, displacing methotrexate from protein, increasing the fraction unbound by 28% [A19653, A19654].&quot;,&quot;Antrafenine is a piperazine derivative drug that acts as an analgesic and anti-inflammatory drug with similar efficacy to naproxen. It is not widely used as it has largely been replaced by newer drugs.&quot;,&quot;Aminophenazone is a pyrazolone with analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and antipyretic properties that carries a risk of agranulocytosis. In biomedical applications, radiolabelled (13C-labeled) aminophenazone has been used in breath tests to measure the cytochrome P-450 metabolic activity in liver function tests.&quot;,&quot;An analgesic and antipyretic that has been given by mouth and as ear drops. Antipyrine is often used in testing the effects of other drugs or diseases on drug-metabolizing enzymes in the liver. (From Martindale, The Extra Pharmacopoeia, 30th ed, p29)&quot;,&quot;Tiaprofenic acid is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug employed in the treatment of pain, particularly arthritis pain. It belongs to the _arylpropionic acid_ (profen) group of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).&quot;,&quot;Etoricoxib is a new COX-2 selective inhibitor. Current therapeutic indications are: treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, chronic low back pain, acute pain and gout. Like any other COX-2 selective inhibitor, Etoricoxib selectively inhibits isoform 2 of cyclo-oxigenase enzyme (COX-2) to reduce the generation of prostaglandins (PGs) from arachidonic acid. It is approved in more than 60 countries worldwide but not in the US.&quot;,&quot;Oxyphenbutazone was withdrawn from the Canadian market in March 1985 due to concerns regarding bone marrow suppression.&quot;,&quot;Nimesulide is a relatively COX-2 selective, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) with analgesic and antipyretic properties. Its approved indications are the treatment of acute pain, the symptomatic treatment of osteoarthritis and primary dysmenorrhoea in adolescents and adults above 12 years old. Due to concerns about the risk of hepatotoxicity, nimesulide has been withdrawn from market in many countries.&quot;,&quot;The use of benoxaprofen, formerly marketed as Oraflex tablets, was associated with fatal cholestatic jaundice among other serious adverse reactions. The holder of the approved application voluntarily withdrew Oraflex tablets from the market on August 5, 1982.&quot;,&quot;Metamizole, formerly marketed as Dimethone tablets and injection, Protemp oral liquid, and other drug products, was associated with potentially fatal agranulocytosis. Approvals of the NDA&#x27;s for dipyrone drug products were withdrawn on June 27, 1977 (see the Federal Register of June 17, 1977 (42 FR 30893)). Withdrawn from the Canadian market in 1963.&quot;,&quot;Lornoxicam (chlortenoxicam) is a new nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) of the oxicam class with analgesic, anti-inflammatory and antipyretic properties. Lornoxicam differs from other oxicam compounds in its potent inhibition of prostaglandin biosynthesis, a property that explains the particularly pronounced efficacy of the drug. Lornoxicam is approved for use in Japan.&quot;,&quot;Aceclofenac is an oral non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) with marked anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties used to treat osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis. It is reported to have a higher anti-inflammatory action or at least comparable effects than conventional NSAIDs in double-blind studies [A19667, A19668, A19670]. Aceclofenac potently inhibits the cyclo-oxygenase enzyme (COX) that is involved in the synthesis of prostaglandins, which are inflammatory mediators that cause pain, swelling, inflammation, and fever. Aceclofenac belongs to BCS Class II as it possesses poor aqueous solubility [A19667]. It displays high permeability to penetrate into synovial joints where in patients with osteoarthritis and related conditions, the loss of articular cartilage in the area causes joint pain, tenderness, stiffness, crepitus, and local inflammation [A19666]. Aceclofenac is also reported to be effective in other painful conditions such as dental and gynaecological conditions [A19672]. In 1991, aceclofenac was developed as an analog of a commonly prescribed NSAID, [DB00586], via chemical modification in effort to improve the gastrointestinal tolerability of the drug. It is a more commonly prescribed drug in Europe.&quot;,&quot;Nepafenac is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory prodrug (NSAID) usually sold as a prescription eye drop. It is used to treat pain and inflammation associated with cataract surgery.&quot;,&quot;Parecoxib is a water-soluble and injectable prodrug of valdecoxib. It is marketed as Dynastat in the European Union. Parecoxib is a COX2 selective inhibitor in the same category as celecoxib (Celebrex) and rofecoxib (Vioxx). As it is injectable, it can be used perioperatively when patients are unable to take oral medications. It is approved through much of Europe for short term perioperative pain control much in the same way ketorolac (Toradol) is used in the United States. A letter of non-approval for parecoxib was issued by the FDA in 2005.&quot;,&quot;Salicylamide is the common name for the substance o-hydroxybenzamide, or amide of salicyl. Salicylamide is a non-prescription drug with analgesic and antipyretic properties. It has similar medicinal uses to aspirin. Salicylamide is used in combination with both aspirin and caffeine in the over-the-counter pain remedies&quot;,&quot;Isoxicam is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug that is not marketed in the United States.&quot;,&quot;Floctafenine is an anti-inflammatory analgesic similar in action to aspirin. Floctafenine inhibits prostaglandin synthesis.&quot;,&quot;Fenbufen is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug used primarily to treat inflammation in osteoarthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, and tendinitis. It can also be used to relieve backaches, sprains, and fractures. Fenbufen is available as a capsule or tablet sold with the brand names Cepal, Cinopal, Cybufen, Lederfen, and Reugast. Fenbufen acts by preventing cyclooxygenase from producing prostaglandins which can cause inflammation.&quot;,&quot;Benzydamine (also known as Tantum Verde or Difflam), available as the hydrochloride salt, is a locally-acting nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) with local anaesthetic and analgesic properties. It is used topically for pain relief and anti-inflammatory treatment of the mouth, throat, or muscoskeletal system.  Although the indazole analogue benzydamine is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), it has various physicochemical properties and pharmacologic activities that are different from those of traditional aspirin-like NSAIDs but facilitate benzydamine&#x27;s mechanism of action as an effective locally-acting NSAID with local anaesthetic and analgesic properties. Moreover, unlike aspirin-like NSAIDs which are acids or metabolised to acids, benzydamine is in fact a weak base.&quot;,&quot;Loxoprofen is a propionic acid derivative non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug. It is marketed under the trade name Loxonin in Brazil, Mexico and Japan by Sankyo, as Loxomac in India, and as Oxeno in Argentina. A transdermal preparation was approved for use in Japan in January 2006.&quot;,&quot;Dexibuprofen, S(+)-ibuprofen, is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). It is a pharmacologically effective enantiomer of racemic ibuprofen that differs in physicochemical properties. It is proposed to be more pharmacologically active and tolerable with a better safety profile than ibuprofen due to higher concentration of active S enantiomer. Dexibuprofen has a slower dissolution rate in the simulated gastric and enteric juices compared with the racemic ibuprofen and displays improved oral bioavilability [A19259]. For Metabolism, Enzymes, Carriers, Transporters Sections, refer to [Ibuprofen].&quot;,&quot;Dexketoprofen is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug. It is available in the various countries in Europe, Asia and Latin America. It has analgesic, antipyretic and anti-inflammatory properties [L1298].&quot;,&quot;Tolfenamic acid, with the formula N-(2-methyl-3-chlorphenyl)-anthranilic acid, is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agent.[A31824] It was discovered by scientists at Medica Pharmaceutical Company in Finland. It is used in the UK as a treatment for migraine under the name of Clotam.[L1292] In the US, it presents a Status class I by the FDA. By the European Medicine Agency, it was granted in 2016 with the status of orphan for the treatment of supranuclear palsy.[L1291]&quot;,&quot;Firocoxib is a cycooxygenase-2 (COX-2) selective non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug. It currently approved for veterinary use in dogs and horses under the brand names Equioxx and Previcox. Firocoxib was the first COX-2 inhibitor approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for horses. Firocoxib is not intended or approved for use in human medicine.&quot;,&quot;Trolamine salicylate is an organic compound or a salt formed between triethanolamine and salicylic acid. Triethanolamine neutralizes the acidity of the salicylic acid. It is a topical analgesic used for temporary relief of minor pain associated with arthritis, simple backache, muscle strains, sprains, and bruises. Unlike other topical analgesics, trolamine salicylate has no distinct odor which improves patient acceptability [A32189]. It also displays low systemic absorption upon dermal or topical administration [A32190] and has low skin irritant properties [A32191]. As with other salicylates, trolamine salicylate is an inhibitor of cyclo-oxygenase (COX) enzymes with no reported selectivity towards a specific enzyme isoform. Trolamine salicylate serves as an active ingredient in topical over-the-counter products for temporary management of mild to moderate muscular and joint pains.&quot;,&quot;Robenacoxib is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug used in veterinary medicine for the relief of pain and inflammation in cats and dogs.&quot;,&quot;Tepoxalin is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug approved for veterinary use in the United States and many other countries. It is primarily used to reduce inflammation and relief of pain caused by musculoskeletal disorders such as hip dysplasia and arthritis.&quot;,&quot;Flunixin is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug for use in pigs, cattle and horses.   It exerts analgesic and antipyretic effects.  This drug is often prepared for use in meglumine salt form. Flunixin is regulated in the United States by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and must be prescribed by a licensed veterinarian. Flunixin may be also referred to as _Banamine_, and other trade names.&quot;,&quot;Alclofenac is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug. It was withdrawn from the market in the United Kingdom in 1979.&quot;,&quot;Bumadizone has been approved for use in Germany and Austria, it is a drug with anti-inflammatory, antipyretic, and analgesic properties, and was marketed for the treatment of both rheumatoid arthritis and gout [L5650]. Its use is restricted to these conditions, due to risks this drug poses [L5650].&quot;,&quot;Bufexamac is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) under the market name Droxaryl, Malipuran, Paraderm and Parfenac. It is typically administered topically for the treatment of subacute and chronic eczema of the skin, including atopic eczema and other inflammatory dermatoses, as well as sunburn and other minor burns, and itching. It has also been used in suppositories in combination with local anaesthetics indicated for haemorrhoids. The use of bufexamac has been discontinued in Canada and the United States, which may be due to undetermined clinical efficacy and a high prevalence of contact sensitization [A32822]. Bufexamac was also withdrawn by the EMA in April 2010.&quot;,&quot;Bendazac is an oxyacetic acid [A39863, A39869]. Despite possessing anti-inflammatory, anti-necrotic, choleretic, and anti-lipidemic characteristics, most research has revolved around studying and demonstrating the agent&#x27;s principal action in inhibiting the denaturation of proteins - an effect that has primarily proven useful in managing and delaying the progression of ocular cataracts [A39863. A39863]. Bendazac, however, has since been withdrawn or discontinued in various international regions due to its capability or risk for eliciting hepatotoxicity [A39891, A39892, A39893, L4778] in patients although a small handful of regions may continue to have the medication available for purchase and use either as a topical anti-inflammatory/analgesic cream or eye drop formulation.&quot;,&quot;NaN&quot;,&quot;Acemetacin is a carboxymethyl ester of indometacin. It is a potent non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, derived from the indol-3-acetic acid, whose activity is thought to be mainly through its active metabolite indomethacin.[A31352] In clinical trials, acemetacin exhibits a better gastric tolerability compared to its active metabolite indometacin.[T50] It was developed by E. Merck and Company in Germany as an attempt to provide a safer drug but other than the amelioration on the gastrointestinal effects, the metabolism of acetamicin led to the formation of indomethacin and it kept the same side effects.[T51]&quot;],&quot;id&quot;:[&quot;DB00159&quot;,&quot;DB00244&quot;,&quot;DB00328&quot;,&quot;DB00461&quot;,&quot;DB00465&quot;,&quot;DB00469&quot;,&quot;DB00482&quot;,&quot;DB00500&quot;,&quot;DB00533&quot;,&quot;DB00554&quot;,&quot;DB00573&quot;,&quot;DB00580&quot;,&quot;DB00586&quot;,&quot;DB00605&quot;,&quot;DB00712&quot;,&quot;DB00749&quot;,&quot;DB00784&quot;,&quot;DB00788&quot;,&quot;DB00795&quot;,&quot;DB00812&quot;,&quot;DB00814&quot;,&quot;DB00821&quot;,&quot;DB00861&quot;,&quot;DB00870&quot;,&quot;DB00936&quot;,&quot;DB00939&quot;,&quot;DB00945&quot;,&quot;DB00963&quot;,&quot;DB00991&quot;,&quot;DB01009&quot;,&quot;DB01014&quot;,&quot;DB01050&quot;,&quot;DB01250&quot;,&quot;DB01283&quot;,&quot;DB01399&quot;,&quot;DB01401&quot;,&quot;DB01419&quot;,&quot;DB01424&quot;,&quot;DB01435&quot;,&quot;DB01600&quot;,&quot;DB01628&quot;,&quot;DB03585&quot;,&quot;DB04743&quot;,&quot;DB04812&quot;,&quot;DB04817&quot;,&quot;DB06725&quot;,&quot;DB06736&quot;,&quot;DB06802&quot;,&quot;DB08439&quot;,&quot;DB08797&quot;,&quot;DB08942&quot;,&quot;DB08976&quot;,&quot;DB08981&quot;,&quot;DB09084&quot;,&quot;DB09212&quot;,&quot;DB09213&quot;,&quot;DB09214&quot;,&quot;DB09216&quot;,&quot;DB09217&quot;,&quot;DB11079&quot;,&quot;DB11455&quot;,&quot;DB11466&quot;,&quot;DB11518&quot;,&quot;DB13167&quot;,&quot;DB13286&quot;,&quot;DB13346&quot;,&quot;DB13501&quot;,&quot;DB13657&quot;,&quot;DB13783&quot;],&quot;index&quot;:[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38,39,40,41,42,43,44,45,46,47,48,49,50,51,52,53,54,55,56,57,58,59,60,61,62,63,64,65,66,67,68],&quot;name&quot;:[&quot;Icosapent&quot;,&quot;Mesalazine&quot;,&quot;Indomethacin&quot;,&quot;Nabumetone&quot;,&quot;Ketorolac&quot;,&quot;Tenoxicam&quot;,&quot;Celecoxib&quot;,&quot;Tolmetin&quot;,&quot;Rofecoxib&quot;,&quot;Piroxicam&quot;,&quot;Fenoprofen&quot;,&quot;Valdecoxib&quot;,&quot;Diclofenac&quot;,&quot;Sulindac&quot;,&quot;Flurbiprofen&quot;,&quot;Etodolac&quot;,&quot;Mefenamic

salicylate is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) used to treat mild to moderate pain. It is available in several over-the-counter (OTC) formulations. Though the recommended doseage is 1160 mg every six hours, per package directions of the Doan&#x27;s OTC brand (580 mg magnesium salicylate tetrahydrate, equivalent to 934.4 mg anhydrous magnesium salicylate), effective pain relief is often found with a half dosage, with reduced anti-inflammatory results.&quot;,&quot;NaN&quot;,&quot;Niflumic acid is an analgesic and anti-inflammatory agent used in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.&quot;,&quot;Developed by the German pharmaceutical company, Merckle GmbH, together with EuroAlliance partners Alfa Wassermann and Lacer, licofelone (ML3000) is a dual COX/LOX inhibitor and the first member of this new class of analgesic and anti-inflammatory drugs. It is currently under evaluation as a treatment for osteoarthritis (OA), the most common form of arthritis. Although phase III trials have been successfully completed in OA patients no dates for regulatory submission have yet been given.&quot;,&quot;Zomepirac, formerly marketed as Zomax tablets, was associated with fatal and near-fatal anaphylactoid reactions. The manufacturer voluntarily removed Zomax tablets from the Canadian, US, and UK markets in March 1983.&quot;,&quot;Cimicoxib is a selective COX-2 inhibitor being developed by Affectis as a treatment for depression and schizophrenia. If approved, Cimicoxib would be the first drug in decades to treat depression by a new mechanism of action.&quot;,&quot;A non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug approved for use in Japan in 1993.&quot;,&quot;NaN&quot;,&quot;NaN&quot;,&quot;Kebuzone (also known as ketophenylbutazone ) is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug.&quot;,&quot;A drug that has analgesic and anti-inflammatory properties. Following reports of adverse reactions including reports of carcinogenicity in animal studies it was withdrawn from the market worldwide.&quot;,&quot;Ibuproxam is a non steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID).&quot;,&quot;Etofenamate is used to treat muscle and joint paint. It is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID).&quot;,&quot;Epirizole is an oral nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) used for muscle and joint pain.&quot;,&quot;Droxicam is an oxicam non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug and a prodrug of [DB00554]. It is used to reduce pain and inflammation in musculoskeletal disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis.&quot;,&quot;Clonixin is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug.&quot;,&quot;Morniflumate is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug with antipyretic properties.  It is the morpholinoethyl ester of niflumic acid [L1496].  In one study, post morniflumate ingestion, physical examination and clinical symptoms of those with bronchitis showed improvement [A7889].&quot;,&quot;Propacetamol is a non-opioid analgesic devoid of the major contraindications.[A32051] It is a derivative of [acetaminophen], or paracetamol, with the molecular formula glycine, N, N-diethyl-,4-(acetylamino)phenyl ester. Propacetamol is a parenteral formulation of paracetamol and thus, it is a prodrug that is completely hydrolyzed to paracetamol.[A7892] It is not available in the United States but this prodrug has been widely used in other countries such as France since 1985.[L1505]&quot;,&quot;Talniflumate, is an anti-inflammatory molecule studied and used as a mucin regulator in the treatment of cystic fibrosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma [L1400]. In addition, it is used in inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis. Phase I trials with talniflumate for the treatment of cystic fibrosis and COPD were completed in August 2001, and phase II trials were performed in Ireland for the treatment of cystic fibrosis but this research has now been discontinued [L1402, L1405]. Talniflumate has been approved for approximately 20 years in Argentina other countries (excluding the United States, Europe, and Japan) [L1405].&quot;,&quot;Polmacoxib has been used in trials studying the treatment of Osteoarthritis, Osteoarthritis, Hip, Osteoarthritis, Knee, Localized Primary Osteoarthritis of Hip, and Localized Primary Osteoarthritis of Knee.&quot;,&quot;Nitroaspirin has been investigated for the treatment of Intermittent Claudication.&quot;,&quot;Betulinic Acid has been used in trials studying the treatment of Dysplastic Nevus Syndrome.&quot;,&quot;Indobufen has been used in trials studying the supportive care and prevention of Atrial Fibrillation.&quot;,&quot;Ebselen has been investigated for the treatment and basic science of Meniere&#x27;s Disease, Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus, and Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus.&quot;,&quot;Tinoridine is under investigation in clinical trial NCT01224756 (Efficacy of Tinoridine in Treating Pain and Inflammation in Adults).&quot;,&quot;NaN&quot;,&quot;NaN&quot;,&quot;Alminoprofen is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) whose physiochemical characteristics make it a member of the phenylpropionic acid class of chemical substances.&quot;,&quot;NaN&quot;,&quot;NaN&quot;,&quot;NaN&quot;,&quot;NaN&quot;,&quot;NaN&quot;,&quot;NaN&quot;,&quot;NaN&quot;,&quot;NaN&quot;,&quot;NaN&quot;,&quot;NaN&quot;,&quot;NaN&quot;,&quot;NaN&quot;,&quot;NaN&quot;,&quot;NaN&quot;,&quot;NaN&quot;,&quot;NaN&quot;,&quot;SC-236 is a potent, selective, orally active inhibitor of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) [L2964] that has been studied in cancer therapy [A33375], lower back pain [A33376], and inflammation [A33373], [A33374],[L2962], [A33377].&quot;,&quot;NS-398 is a COX-2 inhibitor.

acid (ALA) is a polyunsaturated omega-3 fatty acid. It is a component of many common vegetable oils and is important to human nutrition.&quot;,&quot;Methyl salicylate (oil of wintergreen or wintergreen oil) is an organic ester naturally produced by many species of plants, particularly wintergreens. The compound was first extracted and isolated from plant species Gaultheria procumbens in 1843. It can be manufactured synthetically and it used as a fragrance, in foods, beverages, and liniments. It forms a colorless to yellow or reddish liquid and exhibits a characteristic odor and taste of wintergreen. For acute joint and muscular pain, methyl salicylate is used as a rubefacient and analgesic in deep heating liniments. It is used as a flavoring agent in chewing gums and mints in small concentrations and added as antiseptic in mouthwash solutions.&quot;,&quot;Phenyl salicylate is a 2-hydroxybenzoic acid phenyl ester. It is utilized in some manufacturing processes of polymers, lacquers, adhesives, waxes, as well as polishes. It is an active ingredient in some pharmaceutical products as a mild analgesic for pain relief by releasing salicylate (found in [DB00945] ). Phenyl salicylate may also be found in some antiseptic agents [L2467]. It is synthesized by heating salicylic acid with phenol [L2468], [MSDS].  Phenyl salicylate is used as a food additive in the USA [L2479].  This compound belongs to the class of organic compounds known as depsides and depsidones. These are polycyclic compounds that is either a polyphenolic compound composed of two or more monocyclic aromatic units linked by an ester bond (depside), or a compound containing the depsidone structure (depsidone) [L2477].&quot;,&quot;NaN&quot;,&quot;A mixture of fish oil and primrose oil, doconexent is used as a high-docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) supplement. DHA is a 22 carbon chain with 6 cis double bonds with anti-inflammatory effects. It can be biosythesized from alpha-linolenic acid or commercially manufactured from microalgae. It is an omega-3 fatty acid and primary structural component of the human brain, cerebral cortex, skin, and retina thus plays an important role in their development and function. The amino-phospholipid DHA is found at a high concentration across several brain subcellular fractions, including nerve terminals, microsomes, synaptic vesicles, and synaptosomal plasma membranes [A19436].&quot;,&quot;Gamolenic acid, or gamma-linolenic acid (\\u03b3-Linolenic acid) or GLA, is an essential fatty acid (EFA) comprised of 18 carbon atoms with three double bonds [F27] that is most commonly found in human milk and other botanical sources [A32848]. It is an omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) also referred to as 18:3n-6; 6,9,12-octadecatrienoic acid; and cis-6, cis-9, cis-12- octadecatrienoic acid [F27]. Gamolenic acid is produced minimally in the body as the delta 6-desaturase metabolite of [DB00132]. It is converted to [DB00154], a biosynthetic precursor of monoenoic prostaglandins such as PGE1. While Gamolenic acid is found naturally in the fatty acid fractions of some plant seed oils [F27], [DB11358] and [DB11238] are rich sources of gamolenic acid. Evening primrose oil has been investigated for clinical use in menopausal syndrome, diabetic neuropathy, and breast pain, where gamolenic acid is present at concentrations of 7-14% [F27]. Gamolenic acid may be found in over-the-counter dietary supplements. Gamolenic acid is also found in some fungal sources and also present naturally in the form of triglycerides [F27]. Various clinical indications of gamolenic acid have been studied, including rheumatoid arthritis, atopic eczema, acute respiratory distress syndrome, asthma, premenstrual syndrome, cardiovascular disease, ulcerative colitis, ADHD, cancer, osteoporosis, diabetic neuropathy, and insomnia.&quot;,&quot;Dichloralphenazone is a sedative composed of chloral hydrate and phenazone. It is typically found in combination products Nodolor and Midrin containing [isometheptene] and [acetaminophen] used for the relief of tension and vascular headaches. It is a US Schedule IV drug and its clinical use is limited.&quot;,&quot;Glycol salicylate, also known as _2-hydroxyethyl salicylate_, is a benzoate ester formed from the condensation of the carboxy group of salicylic acid with one of the hydroxy groups of ethylene glycol. It is found as an active ingredient and topical analgesic in patches used to provide relief for mild to moderate muscle and joint pain [L2686].   This drug belongs to the _salicylate_ group of drugs, which are used as analgesic agents for the treatment of mild to moderate pain [L2691].  Glycol salicylate (GS), composed of salicylic acid (SA) and ethylene glycol, is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug [L2687].   This ingredient is an important component of many topical creams and sprays for the relief of aches, pains, and stiffness of the muscles, joints, and tendons [L2696].&quot;,&quot;A uricosuric drug that is used to reduce the serum urate levels in gout therapy. It lacks anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and diuretic properties.&quot;,&quot;Icosapent ethyl or ethyl eicosapentaenoic acid is a synthetic derivative of the omega-3 fatty acid eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA). It is used as adjunct therapy for severe hypertriglyceridemia (TG levels &gt; 500 mg/dL). FDA approved on July 26, 2012.&quot;,&quot;An antitubercular agent often administered in association with isoniazid. The sodium salt of the drug is better tolerated than the free acid.&quot;],&quot;id&quot;:[&quot;DB00132&quot;,&quot;DB09543&quot;,&quot;DB11071&quot;,&quot;DB15576&quot;,&quot;DB03756&quot;,&quot;DB13854&quot;,&quot;DB01495&quot;,&quot;DB11323&quot;,&quot;DB01138&quot;,&quot;DB08887&quot;,&quot;DB00233&quot;],&quot;index&quot;:[117,118,119,120,121,122,123,124,125,126,127],&quot;name&quot;:[&quot;alpha-Linolenic acid&quot;,&quot;Methyl salicylate&quot;,&quot;Phenyl salicylate&quot;,&quot;Ethyl salicylate&quot;,&quot;Doconexent&quot;,&quot;Gamolenic acid&quot;,&quot;Dichloralphenazone&quot;,&quot;Glycol salicylate&quot;,&quot;Sulfinpyrazone&quot;,&quot;Icosapent ethyl&quot;,&quot;Aminosalicylic acid&quot;],&quot;x&quot;:{&quot;__ndarray__&quot;:&quot;30xwD8JqDUB1IyAFnBuzv2glCHFIIPW/LyWqm6qbkT/O1ppj7wsOQCV6GgHD0gxA93dEbxC64j9gsKHnrkbLPzK9BTX1P+C/OuBf3ucoDkANr7IXR4fpPw==&quot;,&quot;dtype&quot;:&quot;float64&quot;,&quot;shape&quot;:[11]},&quot;y&quot;:{&quot;__ndarray__&quot;:&quot;kNCDpeDi4b8t0PWztQ77P0NUXE/h8fE/A0ZR1wDI+T9xnJTuebHvv7o2+OFWcei/xNEKEk5K6b8OG4/RZxv5PzihBzKNEve/p9Dk800p9L8ztbhMGM/2Pw==&quot;,&quot;dtype&quot;:&quot;float64&quot;,&quot;shape&quot;:[11]}},&quot;selected&quot;:{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;1192&quot;},&quot;selection_policy&quot;:{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;1193&quot;}},&quot;id&quot;:&quot;1163&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;ColumnDataSource&quot;},{&quot;attributes&quot;:{&quot;fill_alpha&quot;:{&quot;value&quot;:0.1},&quot;fill_color&quot;:{&quot;value&quot;:&quot;orange&quot;},&quot;line_alpha&quot;:{&quot;value&quot;:0.1},&quot;line_color&quot;:{&quot;value&quot;:&quot;orange&quot;},&quot;size&quot;:{&quot;units&quot;:&quot;screen&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:16},&quot;x&quot;:{&quot;field&quot;:&quot;x&quot;},&quot;y&quot;:{&quot;field&quot;:&quot;y&quot;}},&quot;id&quot;:&quot;1160&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;Circle&quot;},{&quot;attributes&quot;:{&quot;data_source&quot;:{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;1157&quot;},&quot;glyph&quot;:{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;1159&quot;},&quot;hover_glyph&quot;:null,&quot;muted_glyph&quot;:null,&quot;nonselection_glyph&quot;:{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;1160&quot;},&quot;selection_glyph&quot;:null,&quot;view&quot;:{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;1162&quot;}},&quot;id&quot;:&quot;1161&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;GlyphRenderer&quot;}],&quot;root_ids&quot;:[&quot;1118&quot;]},&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Bokeh Application&quot;,&quot;version&quot;:&quot;2.0.1&quot;}}';
